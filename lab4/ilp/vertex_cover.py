def vertex_cover_solver(graph):
    """
    Solve vertex cover problem through reduction to an ILP problem and using
    an ILP solver.

    Denote:
    - V = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n} (n = |V|)

    Steps for reduction:
    1. For every vertex v_i create variable x_i for i in [1, n]. It's binary,
       since either x_i is in the vertex cover or it it's not
    2. Objective: minimize x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n
    3. For every edge (v_i, v_j) at least one vertex has to be in the solution:
       x_i + x_j >= 1

    :param graph: graph as list of sets of neighbors
    :return: solved vertex cover and minimal k found or None, if some problem
    occurred
